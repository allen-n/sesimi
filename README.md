The goal of this project is a defense against fixed code gate attack based on the [OpenSesame Attack](https://github.com/samyk/opensesame).

## Getting Started

We're using the ESP8266 board from HiLetgo, youtube video to get up and running on this board, along with some info on it, here: [Getting started with NodeMCU (ESP8266 tutorial #1)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p06NNRq5NTU)

Url to add the board to the arduino IDE: http://arduino.esp8266.com/versions/2.5.0/package_esp8266com_index.json

Node MCU Driver code (necessary if building on Windows like I am), the bottom of your board will tell you which driver you need, the 2102 driver is available here: [CP210x USB to UART Bridge VCP Drivers](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers)

### Prerequisites

In progress FIXME

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

In progress FIXME

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

In progress FIXME
Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
